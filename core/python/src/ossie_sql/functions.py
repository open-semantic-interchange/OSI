"""Function-name compliance levels from ``core-spec/expression_language.md``.

This module is purely informational (see the package README / project plan
for the rationale): the spec's own "Dialect Extensions" section says an
unrecognized function name should pass through by default, so
:mod:`ossie_sql.validate` does *not* use this module to reject expressions.
Instead, :func:`compliance_level` lets callers (tests, tooling, documentation
generators, ...) ask "is this function name part of the portable core the
spec defines, and at what tier?"

This may be used in the future for strict modes and generating warnings.

* Only function *names* are listed here -- operators (``||``, ``%``,
  ``AND``/``OR``/``NOT``, ``LIKE``/``ILIKE``) and typed literals
  (``DATE '...'``) are syntax, not callable names, and don't belong in a
  function-name registry.
* The spec's date-part vocabulary for ``EXTRACT``/``DATE_PART`` (``WEEK``,
  ``DAYOFWEEK``, ``MILLISECOND``, ...) is a separate, closed list of
  *argument* values, not standalone function names, and is intentionally
  excluded from :data:`DATETIME_FUNCTIONS`.
* Names like ``TO_VARCHAR``/``TO_NUMBER``/``TO_BOOLEAN`` appear in some
  draft implementations but are not defined anywhere in the committed
  spec, so they are not included here.
