"""Parse -> generate round-trip tests across the spec's construct categories.

Each case is (input, expected_output) using the Ossie dialect for both
parsing and rendering. Most cases round-trip to themselves; a few
canonicalize to a different (still spec-valid) spelling, which is called
out inline.
