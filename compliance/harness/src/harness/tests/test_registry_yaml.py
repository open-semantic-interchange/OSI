"""Cleanliness gate for the compliance registry YAML files.

``decisions.yaml`` is the source of truth that ties the Foundation spec's
Conformance Decisions to runnable witness tests. ``proposals.yaml``
plays the same role for §3 deferred features. Both files have already
broken at least once because an unquoted ``:`` inside a title was
parsed by YAML as a mapping value (Phase 4 compliance review, finding
B1). This test pins both files so a future edit cannot reintroduce
that class of bug.
