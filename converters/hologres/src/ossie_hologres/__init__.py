"""Bidirectional converter between Apache Ossie semantic models and Alibaba Cloud
Hologres Semantic Views (Hologres V5.0.0+). Pure offline string-in / string-out
transforms.

Export produces `CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW` DDL text rather than YAML, because Hologres has
no YAML import function -- the DDL is the only way to (re)create a Semantic View.
Import consumes the `model_yaml` that Hologres publishes in
`hologres.hg_semantic_view_properties`.

    from ossie_hologres import convert_ossie_to_semantic_view, convert_semantic_view_to_ossie
