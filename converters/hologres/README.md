# Apache Ossie Hologres Converter

Converts between Apache Ossie semantic models and [Alibaba Cloud Hologres](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/hologres)
Semantic Views, available in Hologres V5.0.0 and later.

A Hologres Semantic View declares tables, their relationships, business dimensions and
metrics as a queryable database object. Queries name dimensions and `AGG(metric)` instead
of repeating joins and aggregations, and the engine aggregates each metric within its own
join subtree so a one-to-many join cannot inflate a total.

The two directions are deliberately asymmetric, because Hologres publishes and consumes
its Semantic View definitions in different formats:

- **Export (Ossie -> Hologres)** produces `CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW` **SQL DDL text**.
  Hologres has no YAML import function, so the DDL is the only way to create a
  Semantic View.
- **Import (Hologres -> Ossie)** consumes the **`model_yaml`** that Hologres publishes
  for every Semantic View in the `hologres.hg_semantic_view_properties` system table.

## Installation

```bash
uv sync
```

## Usage

### Command line

Export an Apache Ossie model to DDL and run it:

```bash
ossie-hologres export -i model.yaml -o view.sql
psql -h <endpoint> -p 80 -U <user> -d <db> -f view.sql
```

Import an existing Semantic View back into Apache Ossie. Hologres publishes the
structured model for every Semantic View in a system table:

```bash
psql -h <endpoint> -p 80 -U <user> -d <db> -At -c \
  "SELECT property_value FROM hologres.hg_semantic_view_properties
   WHERE schema_name = current_schema()
     AND view_name = 'sales_sv' AND property_key = 'model_yaml';" > model_yaml.yaml

ossie-hologres import -i model_yaml.yaml -o model.yaml
```

Export options:

| Option | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `--schema` | Schema for the view, and a default for datasets whose `source` has none. Never overrides a schema already written into a `source`. |
| `--database` | Assert the database the dataset sources belong to. |
| `--drop-if-exists` | Prefix a `DROP SEMANTIC VIEW IF EXISTS`. Hologres has no `CREATE OR REPLACE` or `ALTER`, so this is how a definition is changed. |
| `--metric-owner METRIC=DATASET` | Name the table a metric belongs to, for metrics whose expression has no qualified column to infer it from (`COUNT(*)`). Repeatable. |
| `--skip-unsupported-metrics` | Warn about and skip metrics with no Semantic View form instead of failing. |

### Python API

```python
from ossie_hologres import convert_ossie_to_semantic_view, convert_semantic_view_to_ossie

ddl = convert_ossie_to_semantic_view(ossie_yaml, schema="public")
ossie_yaml = convert_semantic_view_to_ossie(model_yaml)
```

## Mapping

| Apache Ossie | Hologres Semantic View |
|--------------|------------------------|
| `semantic_model.name` | `view_name` |
| `semantic_model.description` | view-level `COMMENT` |
| `dataset.name` | `TABLES` alias |
| `dataset.source` | the `[schema.]table` in `TABLES` |
| `dataset.primary_key` | `PRIMARY KEY (...)` |
| `dataset.fields[]` | `DIMENSIONS <alias>.<name> AS <expr>` |
| `field.description` | dimension `COMMENT` |
| `metrics[]` | `METRICS <owner>.<name> AS <agg>` |
| `metric.description` | metric `COMMENT` |
| `relationships[]` | `RELATIONSHIPS <name> AS <from>(cols) REFERENCES <to>(cols)` |

Three mappings are worth explaining.

**Dataset names are table aliases.** On import the Hologres alias (`o`, `c`) becomes the
Ossie dataset name, because the alias is what every dimension, metric and relationship
references. That also makes Hologres' own `sum(o.amount)` already correct as an Ossie
dataset-qualified metric expression.

**Relationship direction carries cardinality.** Hologres records
`relationship_type: many_to_one` and nothing else. Ossie already encodes the same fact in
the direction of a relationship -- `from` is the many side holding the foreign key, `to`
is the one side holding the primary key -- so the type is derived rather than stored.
Getting the direction backwards makes Hologres treat a join as one-to-many and aggregate
a metric more than once, so it matters.

**Metric ownership.** Ossie metrics are model-level; Hologres namespaces each metric under
the table it aggregates. The owner is inferred from the metric expression's column
references. `COUNT(*)` references none, so it needs an explicit owner via a
`custom_extensions` entry or `--metric-owner`; the converter refuses to guess, because
picking the wrong owner silently changes the number under a fan-out join.

**Expressions are read and written as `ANSI_SQL` only.** This converter introduces no
dialect token of its own, so it needs no change to the core spec. Hologres is
PostgreSQL-compatible, but that alone does not justify one: the portable spelling is
nearly always available and sqlglot normalizes to it, so `x::text` becomes
`CAST(x AS TEXT)` in both directions.

For the PostgreSQL-only syntax that does remain -- `j -> 'k'`, `s ~ 'pattern'`, the
1-based `arr[1]` -- the `ANSI_SQL` label is not strictly accurate. It is still the better
trade. A converter that looks for an `ANSI_SQL` expression and finds none *drops the
field* (see `converters/databricks`), so over-labelling loses data silently, whereas an
optimistic label at worst surfaces as a SQL error on the target engine. Deciding this per
expression was tried and abandoned: sqlglot's default dialect is not ANSI SQL, so any such
test mislabels in both directions -- passing `ILIKE` as portable while flagging the
standard `SUBSTRING`, `EXTRACT` and `DATE_TRUNC` as vendor-specific.

## Requirements

Hologres V5.0.0 or later, with `hg_enable_semantic_view_query` on (the default). Confirm
with:

```sql
SELECT hg_version();
```

## Limitations

These come from Hologres itself, not the converter. The converter reports each one with
the offending field named rather than emitting DDL the server will reject.

### Definitions

| Constraint | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| A definition expression must be row-level over a **single** table | A dimension or metric spanning two datasets is rejected |
| Aggregates are limited to `count` / `sum` / `avg` / `min` / `max` | `stddev`, `percentile_cont` and friends are rejected |
| No derived, ratio or filtered metrics | `SUM(a) / COUNT(*)` is rejected; compute it in the query layer |
| A `REFERENCES` target must be the target table's `PRIMARY KEY` | A relationship whose `to_columns` are not the target's key is rejected. A matching `unique_keys` entry is promoted with a warning |
| No window functions, subqueries, `VOLATILE` or set-returning functions | Structurally detectable cases are rejected here; the rest are rejected by Hologres at `CREATE` time |
| A top-level operator in a definition must be parenthesised | Handled automatically: `a \|\| b` is emitted as `(a \|\| b)` |
| Dimension and metric names are referenced bare in queries | Names must be unique across the whole view. Ossie only requires field names to be unique per dataset, so a collision across datasets is rejected rather than silently renamed |
| A Semantic View cannot span databases | Datasets naming different databases are rejected |
| No `CREATE OR REPLACE` or `ALTER SEMANTIC VIEW` | Use `--drop-if-exists` to recreate |

### Information not preserved on export

Hologres offers exactly one annotation slot: `COMMENT`, on the view, each dimension and
each metric. `description` maps there, and a string-form `ai_context` is folded in.
Everything else is reported as a warning rather than dropped silently:
`unique_keys` (unless promoted), `datatype`, `dimension.is_time`, `label`, object-form
`ai_context` (synonyms, instructions, examples), `dataset.description` (the `TABLES`
clause takes no comment), `relationship.ai_context`, and non-`HOLOGRES` vendor
`custom_extensions`.

### Round-trip fidelity

A full loop is lossless for everything Hologres stores:

```
Ossie -> DDL -> Hologres -> model_yaml -> Ossie
```

Two caveats. Expressions come back **normalized, not byte-identical**: sqlglot upper-cases
function names and rewrites `x::text` as `CAST(x AS TEXT)`, and Hologres re-renders
operator expressions with its own parenthesisation and explicit casts. And a `source` is
always rebuilt as a full three-part `database.schema.table` from Hologres' `base_table`,
so a two-part or unqualified `source` gains the missing parts.

## Development

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest
```

### Live tests

A `CREATE SEMANTIC VIEW` statement can only really be validated by a Hologres server, so
the suite includes end-to-end tests that create a view, query it, and read the model back.
They are skipped unless the connection environment variables are set, which keeps CI and a
plain `uv run pytest` hermetic:

```bash
export HOLOGRES_HOST=<endpoint>
export HOLOGRES_PORT=80
export HOLOGRES_USER='BASIC$account'   # single quotes: the $ is literal
export HOLOGRES_PASSWORD='<password>'
export HOLOGRES_DB=<database>

uv sync --group live
uv run pytest -m live -v
```

The tests create everything inside an `ossie_hologres_it` schema and drop it afterwards.
Credentials are read only from the environment; none are stored in this repository.

The `live` dependency group holds the PostgreSQL driver and is excluded from
`default-groups`, so CI never installs a database driver it cannot use.

### Fixtures

The `tests/fixtures` pairs are not hand-written. Each `*_semantic_view.sql` was executed
against a real Hologres 5.0.0 instance and the resulting view queried, and each
`*_model_yaml.yaml` is that instance's own readback of the corresponding DDL. A live test
re-checks the readback against the committed fixture, so if Hologres changes the shape it
emits, the suite says so instead of quietly testing a stale format.

## Future effort

- Import from `ddl_text` as an alternative to `model_yaml`, for views created before
  `model_yaml` was populated.
- Revisit derived and ratio metrics if Hologres gains support for them.
- Map `ai_context` synonyms if Hologres gains an AI annotation surface.
