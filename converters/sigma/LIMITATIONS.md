# Limitations and design tradeoffs

What `converters/sigma` does not map onto a portable Ossie concept, and why. Every
item here is reported at runtime as a `ConverterIssue`, never dropped silently.

## Presentation and governance state is preserved, not modeled

A Sigma table element carries `filters`, `folders`, `order`, `sort`, `summary`,
`groupings`, `columnSecurities`, `visibleAsSource`, per-column `hidden`, and per-metric
`isHighlighted`/`format`/`timeline`. None of these describe the *shape* of a semantic
model — they describe how Sigma displays it and who may see it — and Ossie has no
equivalent for any of them.

All of it is preserved verbatim under a `native` key in the owning object's
`custom_extensions` (`vendor_name: SIGMA`) and restored unchanged on export, matching
how the Databricks, Omni, and Orion Belt converters handle vendor-only features. The
residue is captured **by subtraction** — everything the converter does not explicitly
map — so a future `schemaVersion` that adds fields still round-trips rather than
silently losing them. Element `filters` additionally raise `FILTER_NOT_MODELED`.

## Only `kind: table` elements are modeled

The data model spec defines table elements; the API docs list input tables, Python
elements, UI elements, and custom functions as unsupported programmatically. Any
element with another `kind` is preserved verbatim at the model level under
`non_table_elements` with an `UNSUPPORTED_ELEMENT_KIND` issue. This is a defensive
path, not an expected one.

## Non-warehouse-table sources have no `OSIDataset.source`

`source.kind` may be `warehouse-table`, `sql`, `table`, `data-model`, `join`, or
`union`. Only the first is a `database.schema.table` location, which is what
`OSIDataset.source` is defined to hold. The other five get a readable marker
(`sql:<connectionId>`, `join:<elementId>`, ...) plus a `DERIVED_ELEMENT_NOT_MODELED`
issue; the full native `source` block lives in `custom_extensions`, so export
reproduces it exactly. An Ossie document that never came from Sigma can only ever
produce a `warehouse-table` source, since that is all a location string implies.

## Join keys use two addressing schemes

Sigma addresses a relationship key either by the element's own column id or by a raw
`inode-<file>/<PHYSICAL_COLUMN>` reference straight to the warehouse column, bypassing
the modeled column list. The converter resolves both to a modeled field name where it
can, records `RELATIONSHIP_COLUMN_UNRESOLVED` where it cannot, and **always** keeps the
raw `keys` in `custom_extensions`, so Sigma → Ossie → Sigma is exact either way.

Unsolved: a document authored by another tool has no raw keys to fall back on, so
export must synthesize key ids from field names. That works when every joined field is
a modeled column, but cannot recreate a key pointing at a physical column the element
never redefined.

## Formula coverage is bounded by what Sigma puts in the formula

`ossie_sigma.sigma_formula` parses Sigma's formula language and translates it through a
sqlglot expression tree, covering nested calls, all operators, literals, and ~30
functions across aggregation, conditional, string, and date categories.

Table calculations (`RunningSum`, `Rank`, `Lag`, ...) resolve their partition/order
context from UI configuration rather than from arguments, so nothing in the formula
string can produce correct SQL. These are reported `EXPRESSION_NOT_TRANSLATABLE` and
carry a `SIGMA` dialect entry only. Every formula, translatable or not, is preserved
verbatim in that `SIGMA` entry, so nothing is ever lost on the way in.

Because the intermediate representation is a sqlglot tree rather than SQL text,
emitting a warehouse dialect instead of ANSI is a `dialect=` argument
(`sigma_formula.to_sql`). The converter currently emits `ANSI_SQL` only: Sigma formulas
are warehouse-agnostic, so the spec gives no signal about which vendor dialect would be
more useful, and the table-calculation gap above is unaffected either way.

## Untranslatable expressions are omitted on export, not approximated

`formula` is required on every Sigma column and metric, and the data model API
validates the whole document before applying any of it — so one placeholder formula
fails the entire upload, not one field. When neither a `SIGMA` dialect entry nor a
translatable `ANSI_SQL` one is available, the column or metric is **omitted** with an
`EXPRESSION_NOT_TRANSLATABLE` issue naming it.

## Cross-dataset metrics have no Sigma equivalent

A Sigma metric is scoped to exactly one element; an `OSIMetric` is model-level and may
span datasets via relationships. Sigma → Ossie always promotes cleanly (the owning
`element_id` is preserved). Ossie → Sigma places a metric by its preserved
`element_id`, or, failing that, by the single dataset its ANSI SQL unambiguously
qualifies. A metric that references several datasets or none is dropped with
`CROSS_DATASET_METRIC_DROPPED`.

## Column formats carry only a coarse datatype

The spec has no column datatype — only a display `format`, with two documented kinds,
`number` and `date`. So Sigma → Ossie can infer no more than `Decimal`/`DateTime`, any
other kind becomes `Opaque` (`OPAQUE_DATATYPE`), and a column with no format correctly
gets no `datatype` at all. Ossie → Sigma emits only those two kinds; `String`,
`Boolean`, `Time`, and `Opaque` produce no `format` key, because an invented `kind`
would be rejected for the whole document. The full native format object is always
preserved, so display detail (`formatString`, `currencySymbol`, ...) survives.

## Synthesized ids

Sigma element/column/relationship ids are load-bearing — controls, other data models,
and materializations reference them — so the converter never invents an id for an
object that has one. Native ids ride in `custom_extensions` and are reused verbatim.
Objects originating outside Sigma get a `uuid5` of a fixed namespace plus their
dataset/field path: deterministic across runs, processes, and machines (pinned by
`test_synthesized_ids_are_stable_across_processes`), but not pre-registered with
Sigma's backend.

## One semantic model per document

Sigma data models are single models; `OSIDocument.semantic_model` is a list. Only
`semantic_model[0]` is converted, with `EXTRA_MODEL_DROPPED` naming how many were
dropped.
