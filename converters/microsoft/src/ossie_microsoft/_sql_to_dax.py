"""A deliberately narrow SQL-to-DAX translator for Apache Ossie expressions.

Apache Ossie fields and metrics can carry SQL expressions; Power BI evaluates
calculated columns and measures only as DAX. Rather than attempt a general translation,
this module recognises a closed set of shapes whose DAX equivalent is unambiguous, and
refuses everything else.

The governing rule is the one stated in `_common`: never emit a plausible-looking
expression that was not authored for the target engine. A metric this module declines
is reported and skipped, which a modeller notices; a metric it mistranslates would
deploy cleanly and quietly return a wrong number.

What is translated
------------------
A single aggregate call over one column, `COUNT(*)`, division between supported
aggregates, division by ``NULLIF(aggregate, 0)``, and string concatenations made only
from columns and string literals. Concretely::

    SUM(amount)            ->  SUM('Sales'[Amount])
    COUNT(DISTINCT cust)   ->  DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANK('Sales'[Customer])
    COUNT(*)               ->  COUNTROWS('Sales')
    SUM(s.sales) / COUNT(*) -> DIVIDE(SUM('s'[sales]), COUNTROWS('s'))
    first || ' ' || last   ->  'Customer'[First] & " " & 'Customer'[Last]

What is refused
---------------
Everything else, including non-division arithmetic, aggregates over expressions
(`SUM(a + b)`), `CASE`, `DISTINCT` outside `COUNT`, `FILTER`/`OVER` clauses, and any
column that cannot be resolved to exactly one dataset. Ambiguity is treated as failure,
never as a guess.

Why the column must resolve
---------------------------
DAX has no bare column reference: `SUM(amount)` is not valid DAX, only
`SUM('Sales'[Amount])` is. The physical name in the SQL (`amount`) is also not
necessarily the Power BI column name -- it is the field's `sourceColumn`, while DAX
addresses the column by its model `name`. So a translation is only possible when the
column resolves to exactly one field in exactly one dataset.

Differences that are left in place
----------------------------------
Two divergences from SQL are deliberate, because both fail *visibly* rather than
returning a quietly wrong number:

* SQL `COUNT` returns 0 over an empty set, whereas the DAX count functions return
  BLANK. Coercing to 0 would need a wrapper on every measure and would defeat Power
  BI's convention of hiding empty rows in a visual, so BLANK is kept.
* DAX `STDEV.S`, `STDEV.P`, `VAR.S` and `VAR.P` raise an error when fewer than two
  non-blank rows remain, where SQL yields NULL (sample) or 0 (population). That
  surfaces as a visible error rather than a plausible wrong figure.

#: * SQL `COUNT(DISTINCT x)` excludes NULL, but DAX `DISTINCTCOUNT` counts BLANK as a
#:   distinct value, which is off by one on any nullable column. `DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANK`
#:   is the equivalent.
