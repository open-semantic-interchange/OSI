"""Shared helpers for the Apache Ossie <-> Microsoft Power BI converters.

Cross-cutting concerns live here: version constants, the data type mapping in both
directions, the `custom_extensions` stash protocol, and the warning helper used to
report every lossy step.

Design rule for this converter pair: **never emit a plausible-looking expression that
was not authored for the target engine**. Power BI measures are DAX; Apache Ossie field
expressions are usually SQL. The two are not interchangeable, and a partial SQL-to-DAX
rewrite that silently produces invalid or subtly wrong DAX is worse than a refusal.
Where an expression cannot be carried across faithfully, the converter warns and skips
rather than guessing.

# handler an embedding application configured, without that application having to
# install a warning filter.

# The TMSL `dataType` vocabulary is the TOM DataType enum. Note that it has no

# as `dateTime` and distinguishes date-only presentation purely via `formatString`.
# The Apache Ossie temporal types therefore do not survive a round trip on the
# `dataType` alone, which is why DATE_ONLY_FORMAT_RE exists below.
#
# Precision caveats that converters and consumers should be aware of:
#   * `int64`   -- a 64-bit integer in the model, but Power BI report visuals can only
#                  safely express values up to 2**53 - 1 (9007199254740991).
#   * `decimal` -- "Fixed Decimal Number": 19 digits of significance, exactly 4 digits
#                  to the right of the decimal point. Maps to Ossie `Decimal` (exact).
#   * `double`  -- "Decimal Number": 64-bit floating point, ~15 digits of precision and
#                  approximate. Maps to Ossie `Float`, NOT `Decimal`.
#   * `dateTime` -- model range is years 1900-9999 and time is stored at 1/300 second
#                  (3.33 ms) granularity, so sub-millisecond source data loses fidelity.
