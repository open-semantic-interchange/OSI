    A dotted reference resolves to whichever form Cube expects:

    The own cube is always referenced as `{CUBE}` rather than by name, so the

    `inline_sql` maps `{cube: {field: cube_sql}}` for Ossie fields that have no

    so a reference to it becomes the half's own SQL (`{CUBE}.lat`), requalified when

    A dotted token inside a string literal is left alone. This matters more than it
    looks: Cube compiles a YAML `sql` as a Python f-string, so a `{...}` it emitted
