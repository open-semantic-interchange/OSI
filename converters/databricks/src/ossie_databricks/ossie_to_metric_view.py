"""Convert an Apache Ossie semantic model to a Databricks Unity Catalog Metric View (v1.1).

Pure offline conversion -- no Databricks connection required. Produces the
Metric View: one fact `source` with a nested `joins` tree and
all fields flattened into one `dimensions` list. See README.md for the
capability summary and limitations.

Usage (CLI):
