"""Property-based round-trip tests (Hypothesis).

For any generated model in the round-trippable subset, converting one direction and
back preserves content:

  - MV  -> Apache Ossie -> MV : source, every dimension/measure name+expression+metadata, every
    join (name, source, condition, cardinality, rely) and the join nesting, and the
    model-level filter/comment/materialization.
  - Apache Ossie -> MV -> Apache Ossie : dataset names+sources+fields, relationship from/to/columns,
    metric name+expression, and the model description.

The model generation and the assertions live in `_roundtrip_helpers` (no test-framework
dependency) so the exact same logic also runs under a plain seeded RNG where Hypothesis
is unavailable (see the `*_seeded` tests in test_roundtrip.py). This file is the thin
Hypothesis driver: it maps draws into the shared `Rnd` interface and runs the properties.

Run: `pytest test_roundtrip_properties.py` (needs `hypothesis`).
