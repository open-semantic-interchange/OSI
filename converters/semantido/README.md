# semantido ⇄ Apache Ossie converter

Converts between [semantido](https://github.com/hikarilabs/semantido) — a
code-native semantic layer authored as decorators on SQLAlchemy models and
Apache Ossie semantic model documents.

Unlike file-to-file converters, semantido's source of truth is live Python:
the forward direction imports a module of decorated models, syncs the
semantic layer, and emits Ossie YAML through the typed `apache-ossie`
objects. The reverse direction is code generation: it produces a Python
module of `@semantic_table`-decorated models from an Ossie document.

Tracks the **semantido ≥ 0.5.2** surface: concept bindings (`concept=` /
`<column>_concept`), the concept registry — definitions, relations,
external mappings, and grain — carried as a model-level custom extension,
and `unique_keys`. A module-level `CONCEPT_REGISTRY` in the loaded models
module is passed to `sync_semantic_layer()` automatically; the reverse
direction regenerates it as a `build_registry()` function.

## Usage

```bash
# decorated SQLAlchemy models -> Ossie YAML
ossie-semantido semantido-to-osi \
    -m models.[SQLAlchemy model] -p ./my_project \
    -n [model name] -o [model].osi.yaml

# Ossie YAML -> generated semantido model code
ossie-semantido osi-to-semantido \
    -i [model].osi.yaml -o generated_model_[model name].py
```

## Mapping

| semantido                                 | Ossie                             | Notes                                                |

| decorated table                           | `datasets[]`                      | `source` from schema-qualified table name            |
| column                                    | `fields[]`                        | expression emitted as `ANSI_SQL` column reference    |
| `description` / `<col>_description`       | `description`                     |                                                      |
| `business_context`, `application_context` | dataset `ai_context.instructions` |                                                      |
| `synonyms` / `<col>_synonyms`             | `ai_context.synonyms`             |                                                      |
| `<col>_sample_values`                     | field `ai_context.examples`       |                                                      |
| `time_dimension=` + `<col>_time_grain`    | field `dimension.is_time`         | grain preserved in extensions                        |
| FK relationships                          | `relationships[]`                 | join condition parsed to `from_columns`/`to_columns` |
| `sql_filters`                             | dataset `custom_extensions`       | no Ossie core field (see below)                      |
| `<col>_privacy_level`                     | field `custom_extensions`         | no Ossie core field (see below)                      |

### Metadata carried in `custom_extensions`

semantido captures runtime-governance metadata that has no core-spec home
in Ossie today: per-field privacy classification, default SQL filters /
row-level security fragments, and time-dimension grain. These are preserved
losslessly under `vendor_name: SEMANTIDO` with `data` as a serialized JSON
string, so no information is lost in interchange — but tools without
semantido awareness will not interpret them.

### Known lossy conversions

Conversions report structured `ConverterIssue`s (mirroring `ossie_dbt`):
Ossie metrics and non-ANSI dialect expressions have no semantido
equivalent and are dropped with a recorded issue; generated code lists
them in a TODO block for review.

## Tests

The test fixture is an EMIR (European Market Infrastructure Regulation)
trade-reporting model — a regulated-industry schema whose semantics
(role-bridge fan-out, signed vs. unsigned amount conventions,
notional/valuation ambiguity) demonstrate why interchange must carry
business meaning, not just structure.

```bash
uv run pytest tests/
