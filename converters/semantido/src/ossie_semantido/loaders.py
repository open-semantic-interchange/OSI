"""Entry points for loading a semantido SemanticLayer.

semantido's source of truth is live Python (decorated SQLAlchemy models),
so the primary loader imports a module and syncs the layer. A file-based
path is not provided in this converter: semantido's JSON export is a
rendering of the same layer, and consumers who have the JSON already have
a semantic model they can transform directly.
