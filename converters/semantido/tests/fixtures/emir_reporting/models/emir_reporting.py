"""EMIR trade-reporting semantic model (regulated-industry fixture).

Simplified but structurally honest EMIR REFIT reporting schema. It
deliberately encodes three semantics-dependent failure modes that plain
DDL cannot express: bridge fan-out via the counterparty role table, sign
conventions (signed valuations vs. unsigned posted/received collateral),
and amount ambiguity (notional vs. valuation vs. collateral).
