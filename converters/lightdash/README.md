# Apache Ossie <> Lightdash converter

Bidirectional converter between Ossie documents and
[Lightdash](https://github.com/lightdash/lightdash) semantic definitions.
Lightdash reads its semantic layer from dbt `schema.yml` files: dimensions and
metrics are declared per column (and per model) under `meta`. This converter
translates between that shape and Ossie.

- **Export** (`osi_to_lightdash`): Ossie document → a dbt `schema.yml`-shaped
  dictionary with Lightdash `meta` blocks, ready to merge into a dbt project.
- **Import** (`lightdash_to_osi`): a Lightdash-flavoured `schema.yml` → an
  Ossie document, as a migration path for teams with an existing installed
  base of Lightdash metrics.

```
ossie-lightdash export semantic_model.yaml schema.yml
ossie-lightdash import schema.yml semantic_model.json --database analytics_db --schema marts
```

## Mapping

| Ossie | Lightdash (dbt meta) |
| ----- | -------------------- |
| `dataset` | dbt model (`name` = table part of `source`) |
| `dataset.source` | assembled on import from `--database` / `--schema` / model name |
| `field` (no `dimension`) | plain column entry |
| `field` with `dimension` | `columns[].meta.dimension` (an empty `dimension: {}` marks a dimension with no extra attributes) |
| `field.datatype` | `meta.dimension.type` (`String`→`string`, `Integer`/`Decimal`/`Float`→`number`, `Date`→`date`, `DateTime`/`DateTimeTz`→`timestamp`, `Boolean`→`boolean`, `Time`/`Opaque`→`string`); on import `number` maps back to `Decimal` |
| `field.dimension.is_time` | *not carried* — it is a role marker (a field can be a time axis without a temporal datatype, e.g. a year stored as `Integer`) and Lightdash has no equivalent |
| `field.label` / `.description` | `meta.dimension.label` / column `description` |
| `field.expression` (≠ column name) | `meta.dimension.sql` (`dataset.col` ↔ `${TABLE}.col`) |
| `metric` with single-aggregation expression (`SUM(ds.col)`, `COUNT(DISTINCT ds.col)`, ...) | column-level `meta.metrics.<name>` with a typed metric (`sum`, `count_distinct`, ...) |
| `metric` with any other single-dataset expression | model-level `meta.metrics.<name>` with `type: number` + `sql` |
| `relationship` | `meta.joins` (`sql_on` built from / parsed into column pairs) |
| Lightdash presentation attributes (`label`, `format`, `round`, `compact`, `group_label`, `hidden`, `percentile`, ...) | `custom_extensions` with `vendor_name: "lightdash"`; on export the extension data is overlaid onto the generated definition (structural keys — `sql`/`label` on dimensions, `sql`/`description` on metrics — are protected and cannot be overridden) |

Expressions are written under the `ANSI_SQL` dialect. Warehouse-specific
dialects (e.g. `BIGQUERY`) can be added once the surrounding tooling resolves
them.

## Recommended source shape for dbt-native flows

If the Ossie documents are also consumed by dbt's native OSI parsing, prefer
importing **without** `--database` (i.e. `schema.table` sources): the database
is usually environment-dependent in dbt projects, and a database-less source
keeps one document valid across environments (see
[dbt-core#15649](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/15649)).
Omitting `--schema` as well is reported as a `SOURCE_UNQUALIFIED` issue.

## Known limitations

- **Cross-dataset metrics are dropped on export** (with a
  `CROSS_DATASET_METRIC_DROPPED` issue): a Lightdash model metric cannot
  reference other tables.
- **Percentile metrics** keep `type` / `percentile` in the `lightdash`
  extension (Ossie expressions cannot express them faithfully) and re-export
  as model-level metrics.
- **`primary_key` / `unique_keys` are not exported** — Lightdash has no
  corresponding concept — and consequently cannot be reconstructed on import.
- **`dataset.name` is not preserved when it differs from the source table
  name**: the dbt model is named after the table part of `source`, and the
  import direction derives dataset names from model names. References inside
  expressions and relationships are rewritten consistently, but a
  name-stable round-trip is not guaranteed.
- **Relationships with mismatched `from_columns` / `to_columns` lengths are
  skipped on export** with a `RELATIONSHIP_COLUMNS_MISMATCHED` issue.
- **Datatypes round-trip by category, not by exact type**: Lightdash types are
  coarser than Ossie datatypes, so `Integer` comes back as `Decimal` and
  `DateTimeTz` as `DateTime`.
- **A measure-only field (no `dimension`) loses its `datatype`**: Lightdash
  carries types on dimensions only, so there is nowhere to put it.
- **`dimension.is_time` is not carried**, and a field whose datatype is not
  temporal but is flagged as a time axis is reported with a
  `TIME_ROLE_NOT_REPRESENTABLE` issue on export.
- **`ai_context` is not carried** into Lightdash meta.
- **Model-level Lightdash meta beyond `metrics` and `joins`** (`label`,
  `group_details`, `sql_filter`, `order_fields_by`, column
  `additional_dimensions`, ...) is not carried yet.
- **Standalone Lightdash YAML projects** (Lightdash without dbt) are not
  supported yet; the converter targets the dbt-meta flavour.
- Custom extensions from other vendors are ignored on export (reported as
  `FOREIGN_EXTENSION_IGNORED`); they remain untouched in the Ossie document.
- Documents are emitted at the current in-repo spec version. Note that
  dbt-core 1.12's native OSI parsing accepts spec versions `0.1.0` / `0.1.1`
  only.
