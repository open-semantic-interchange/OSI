# GoodData Apache Ossie Converter

Bidirectional converter between GoodData's declarative Logical Data Model (LDM)
and the [Apache Ossie](https://github.com/apache/ossie)
semantic model specification.

## Features

- **GoodData → Ossie**: Convert a GoodData declarative LDM JSON to Ossie semantic model YAML
- **Ossie → GoodData**: Convert an Ossie semantic model YAML to GoodData declarative LDM JSON
- Preserves GoodData-specific metadata (labels, date granularities, geo types) via Ossie custom_extensions
- Generates dual-dialect expressions (ANSI_SQL + MAQL) for fields

## Usage

```python
import json
import yaml
from ossie_gooddata import gooddata_to_osi, osi_to_gooddata
from ossie_gooddata.models import gd_model_from_dict, gd_model_to_dict

# GoodData → Apache Ossie
with open("gooddata_ldm.json") as f:
    gd_model = gd_model_from_dict(json.load(f))
osi_model = gooddata_to_osi(gd_model, model_name="my_model")
with open("osi_model.yaml", "w") as f:
    yaml.dump(osi_model, f, default_flow_style=False)

# Apache Ossie → GoodData
with open("osi_model.yaml") as f:
    osi_data = yaml.safe_load(f)
gd_model = osi_to_gooddata(osi_data, data_source_id="my_datasource")
with open("gooddata_ldm.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(gd_model_to_dict(gd_model), f, indent=2)
```

## Development

```bash
uv sync --group dev
uv run pytest
```

## Concept Mapping

| GoodData LDM | Ossie Semantic Model |
|---|---|
| Dataset | Dataset |
| Attribute (+ Labels) | Field with `dimension` metadata |
| Fact | Field without `dimension` metadata |
| Source column data type | Field `datatype` |
| Reference (FK) | Relationship |
| Date Instance | Dataset with `GOODDATA` custom_extension (`date_dimension: true`) |
| MAQL expression | Dialect entry (`dialect: MAQL`) |

### Data Types

| GoodData source type | Ossie `DataType` |
|---|---|
| `STRING` | `String` |
| `INT` | `Integer` |
| `NUMERIC` | `Decimal` |
| `BOOLEAN` | `Boolean` |
| `DATE` | `Date` |
| `TIMESTAMP` | `DateTime` |
| `TIMESTAMP_TZ` | `DateTimeTz` |

Only an explicitly present GoodData `sourceColumnDataType` becomes an Ossie
`datatype`. If GoodData omits the source type, the Ossie datatype remains
unspecified rather than being inferred from whether the field is an attribute or fact.

Unknown GoodData source types become `Opaque` and their exact value is retained in a
`GOODDATA` custom extension for lossless round trips. Regular GoodData attributes remain
explicitly non-time dimensions even when their source column has a temporal data type;
GoodData date instances continue to carry the time-dimension role.

## Limitations

- **Metrics are not converted.** GoodData metrics use MAQL, a context-aware metric language
  where dimensionality and filters are applied at report time. The current Ossie metric model
  is SQL-expression-based and cannot represent this paradigm.
- AggregatedFacts are not yet supported.
- Workspace data filters are not mapped.
- GoodData has only one `NUMERIC` source type, so exporting Ossie `Float` loses the
  distinction between approximate and exact numeric values.
- GoodData has no time-only source type. Ossie `Time` fields retain the existing
  attribute or fact default and emit a warning when exported.
- Ossie `Opaque` fields require an exact GoodData source type in their `GOODDATA`
  extension for lossless export; otherwise the role default is used with a warning.
