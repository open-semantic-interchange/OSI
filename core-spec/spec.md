## Enumerations

Standard enumeration values used throughout the specification.

### Dialects

Supported SQL and expression language dialects for metrics and field definitions.

| Dialect | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ANSI_SQL` | Standard SQL dialect |
| `SNOWFLAKE` | Snowflake SQL |
| `MDX` | Multi-Dimensional Expressions |
| `TABLEAU` | Tableau calculations |
| `DATABRICKS` | Databricks SQL |
| `MAQL` | GoodData MAQL (Metric Analysis and Query Language) |
| `BIGQUERY` | Google BigQuery (GoogleSQL) |
| `THOUGHTSPOT` | ThoughtSpot formula language |

### Data types

`DataType` declares the logical value type of a field or metric independently
of its role and physical representation. The shared names align with the
ontology specification's built-in value types; `Time`, `DateTimeTz`, and
`Opaque` are additional core data types.

| DataType | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `String` | Variable-length Unicode character data; length and collation are unspecified. |
| `Integer` | Exact integral number; width and signedness are unspecified. |
| `Decimal` | Exact base-10 number; precision and scale are unspecified. |
| `Float` | Approximate floating-point number. |
| `Boolean` | Logical two-valued truth type. |
| `Date` | Calendar date with no time-of-day component. |
| `Time` | Time-of-day with no date or timezone. |
| `DateTime` | Local/civil date and time with no timezone or offset. |
| `DateTimeTz` | Date and time with sufficient offset or timezone context to identify an instant. Preservation of a named timezone identifier is not guaranteed. |
| `Opaque` | Known type outside the portable vocabulary; use `custom_extensions` for vendor-specific refinement. Omit `datatype` when the type is unknown or unspecified. |

## Semantic Model

The top-level container that represents a complete semantic model, including datasets, relationships, and  metrics.

### Schema

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Unique identifier for the semantic model |
| `description` | string | No | Human-readable description |
| `ai_context` | string/object | No | Additional context for AI tools (e.g., custom instructions) |
| `datasets` | array | Yes | Collection of logical datasets (fact and dimension tables) |
| `relationships` | array | No | Defines how logical datasets are connected |
| `metrics` | array | No | Model-scoped metrics: for expressions that must combine fields from more than one dataset. See [Metric Scoping](#metric-scoping). |
| `custom_extensions` | array | No | Vendor-specific attributes for extensibility |

### Example

```yaml
semantic_model:
  - name: sales_analytics
    description: Sales and customer analytics model
    ai_context:
      instructions: "Use this model for sales analysis and customer insights"
    datasets:
      - name: orders
        source: sales.public.orders
    relationships: []
    metrics: []
    custom_extensions:
      - vendor_name: DBT
        data: '{"project_name": "tpcds_analytics", "models_path": "models/semantic"}'
```

---

## Datasets

Logical datasets represent business entities or concepts (fact and dimension tables). They contain fields and define the structure of the data.

### Schema

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Unique identifier for the dataset |
| `source` | string | Yes | Reference to underlying physical table/view (e.g., `database.schema.table`) or query |
| `primary_key` | array | No | Primary key columns that uniquely identify rows (single or composite) |
| `unique_keys` | array of arrays | No | Array of unique key definitions (each can be single or composite) |
| `description` | string | No | Human-readable description |
| `ai_context` | string/object | No | Additional context for AI tools (e.g., synonyms, common terms) |
| `fields` | array | No | Row-level attributes for grouping, filtering, and metric expressions |
| `metrics` | array | No | Dataset-scoped metrics whose expressions resolve entirely within this dataset. See [Metric Scoping](#metric-scoping). |
| `custom_extensions` | array | No | Vendor-specific attributes |

### Primary Key Examples

```yaml
# Simple primary key
primary_key: [customer_id]

# Composite primary key
primary_key: [order_id, line_number]
```

### Unique Keys Examples

```yaml
# Multiple unique keys (each can be simple or composite)
unique_keys:
  - [email]                    # Simple unique key
  - [first_name, last_name]    # Composite unique key
```

### Example

```yaml
datasets:
  - name: orders
    source: sales.public.orders
    primary_key: [order_id]
    unique_keys:
      - [order_id]
      - [order_number]
    description: Order transactions
    ai_context:
      synonyms:
        - "purchases"
        - "sales"
    fields: []
    custom_extensions:
      - vendor_name: DBT
        data: '{"materialized": "table"}'
```

---

## Relationships

Relationships define how logical datasets are connected through foreign key constraints. They support both simple and composite keys.

### Schema

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Unique identifier for the relationship |
| `from` | string | Yes | The logical dataset on the many side of the relationship |
| `to` | string | Yes | The logical dataset on the one side of the relationship |
| `from_columns` | array | Yes | Array of column names in the "from" dataset (foreign key columns) |
| `to_columns` | array | Yes | Array of column names in the "to" dataset (primary or unique key columns) |
| `ai_context` | string/object | No | Additional context for AI tools |
| `custom_extensions` | array | No | Vendor-specific attributes |

### Important Notes

- The order of columns in `from_columns` must correspond to the order in `to_columns`
- Both arrays must have the same number of columns
- For simple relationships, use a single column: `[column1]`
- For composite relationships, use multiple columns: `[column1, column2]`

### Examples

**Simple Relationship:**

```yaml
- name: orders_to_customers
  from: orders
  to: customers
  from_columns: [customer_id]
  to_columns: [id]
```

**Composite Relationship:**

```yaml
# order_lines.product_id = products.id AND order_lines.variant_id = products.variant_id
- name: order_lines_to_products
  from: order_lines
  to: products
  from_columns: [product_id, variant_id]
  to_columns: [id, variant_id]
```

---

## Fields

Fields represent row-level attributes that can be used for grouping, filtering, and in metric expressions. They can be simple column references or computed expressions.

### Schema

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Unique identifier for the field within the dataset |
| `expression` | object | Yes | Expression definition with dialect support |
| `dimension` | object | No | Dimension metadata (e.g., `is_time` flag) |
| `label` | string | No | Label for categorization |
| `description` | string | No | Human-readable description |
| `datatype` | string (enum) | No | Logical data type for this field. See [Data types](#data-types). |
| `ai_context` | string/object | No | Additional context for AI tools (e.g., synonyms) |
| `custom_extensions` | array | No | Vendor-specific attributes |

### Expression Object

The expression object supports multiple SQL dialects for cross-platform compatibility. Each field can define expressions in different dialects.

**Structure:**

```yaml
expression:
  dialects:
    - dialect: ANSI_SQL  # Must be one of the dialects enum values
      expression: "customer_id"  # Scalar SQL expression
```

**Key Points:**

- Use scalar SQL expressions (no aggregations)
- Can be simple column references (e.g., `customer_id`) or computed expressions (e.g., `first_name || ' ' || last_name`)
- Multiple dialect versions can be provided for the same field

### Dimension Object

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `is_time` | boolean | Temporal-role marker. When `true`, consumers that distinguish time dimensions (e.g. for time-series analysis or temporal filtering) should treat this field as a time dimension. This is a *role* flag, independent of the field's data type. See [DataType and `is_time`: type vs. role](#datatype-and-is_time-type-vs-role). |

### Examples

**Simple Column Reference for a Dimension:**

```yaml
- name: customer_id
  expression:
    dialects:
      - dialect: ANSI_SQL
        expression: customer_id
  description: Customer identifier
  dimension:
    is_time: false
```

**Computed Field:**

```yaml
- name: full_name
  expression:
    dialects:
      - dialect: ANSI_SQL
        expression: first_name || ' ' || last_name
  description: Customer full name
  ai_context:
    synonyms:
      - "name"
      - "customer name"
```

**Time Dimension:**

```yaml
- name: order_date
  expression:
    dialects:
      - dialect: ANSI_SQL
        expression: order_date
  datatype: Date
  dimension:
    is_time: true
  description: Date when order was placed
  ai_context:
    synonyms:
      - "purchase date"
      - "transaction date"
```

**Multi-Dialect Field:**

```yaml
- name: email_normalized
  expression:
    dialects:
      - dialect: ANSI_SQL
        expression: LOWER(email)
      - dialect: SNOWFLAKE
        expression: LOWER(email)::VARCHAR
      - dialect: BIGQUERY
        expression: SAFE_CAST(LOWER(email) AS STRING)
  description: Normalized email address
```

### DataType and `is_time`: type vs. role

`datatype` and `dimension.is_time` are independent properties that answer different questions:

- **`datatype`** describes the *data type* of the field (e.g. `Date`, `Integer`, `String`, `DateTimeTz`): what kind of values the field holds.
- **`dimension.is_time`** is a *temporal-role marker*: whether the field should be treated as a time dimension for time-series analysis or temporal filtering, regardless of its data type.

**Default for `is_time`.** When `is_time` is not set explicitly, it defaults to `true` if `datatype` is one of `Date`, `Time`, `DateTime`, `DateTimeTz`, and `false` otherwise. Explicit `is_time` always wins. Set `is_time: false` on a temporal-typed column (e.g. an audit `created_at` you don't want on the time axis) to opt out of the default.

Common combinations:

| Column example | `datatype` | `is_time` | Effective role | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `d_date` (calendar date) | `Date` | omitted | time dimension | Temporal `datatype`; `is_time` defaults to `true`. |
| `order_timestamp` | `DateTimeTz` | omitted | time dimension | Same. |
| `created_at` (audit timestamp) | `DateTime` | `false` | regular dimension | Explicit opt-out of the temporal default. |
| `d_year` (integer year grain) | `Integer` | `true` | time dimension | Non-temporal `datatype`; `is_time: true` makes the role explicit. |
| `d_quarter_name` (e.g. `"Q1"`) | `String` | `true` | time dimension | String-valued temporal grain. |
| `customer_id` | `Integer` | omitted | regular dimension | Non-temporal `datatype`; `is_time` defaults to `false`. |

> **Precedent.** This type/role separation mirrors [Snowflake Semantic Views' YAML authoring form](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/views-semantic/semantic-view-yaml-spec), which has a structural `time_dimensions:` collection whose entries can carry any `data_type`. The published example annotates `order_year` with `data_type: NUMBER`. LookML supports a similar split via its [`dimension_group`](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/reference/param-field-dimension-group), whose `datatype` enum covers `date`, `datetime`, `timestamp`, plus the integer-encoded forms `epoch` and `yyyymmdd`.

**Consumer guidance.**

- For *data-type* questions (casting, serialization, downstream type inference): prefer `datatype` when present. If only `is_time: true` is set, do not infer a specific scalar type from it.
- For *role* questions (classifying time dimensions in a query UI, generating time-series output sections, choosing time-aware aggregations): treat the field as a time dimension when `is_time` resolves to `true`, whether explicitly set or defaulted from a temporal `datatype`.

---

## Metrics

Quantitative measures defined on business data, representing key calculations like sums, averages, ratios, etc.

Metrics may be defined in two placements, using the same structure in both:

- **Model-scoped** (`semantic_model.metrics`): for expressions that must combine fields from more than one dataset.
- **Dataset-scoped** (`datasets[].metrics`): aggregates data held by one dataset. Still joined and grouped through the model's relationships like any other metric.

See [Metric Scoping](#metric-scoping) for the rules governing each.

### Schema

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Unique identifier for the metric |
| `expression` | object | Yes | Expression definition with dialect support |
| `description` | string | No | Human-readable description of what the metric measures |
| `datatype` | string (enum) | No | Logical data type for this metric. See [Data types](#data-types). |
| `ai_context` | string/object | No | Additional context for AI tools (e.g., synonyms) |
| `custom_extensions` | array | No | Vendor-specific attributes |

### Expression Object

The expression object supports multiple dialects

```yaml
expression:
  dialects:
  - dialect: ANSI_SQL  # Default
    expression: "SUM(order.sales) / COUNT(DISTINCT order.customer_id)"
```

### Examples

**Simple Aggregation:**

```yaml
- name: total_revenue
  expression:
    dialects:
      - dialect: ANSI_SQL
        expression: SUM(orders.amount)
  description: Total revenue across all orders
  datatype: Decimal
  ai_context:
    synonyms:
      - "total sales"
      - "revenue"
```

**Cross-Dataset Metric:**

```yaml
- name: avg_orders
  expression:
    dialects:
      - dialect: ANSI_SQL
        expression: SUM(orders.amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT customers.id)
  description: Average orders
  datatype: Decimal
  ai_context:
    synonyms:
      - "Order Average by customer"
```

---

## Metric Scoping

A metric may be defined at the semantic model level or on an individual dataset. Both placements use the identical metric structure; only the resolution rules differ.

| | Model-scoped (`semantic_model.metrics`) | Dataset-scoped (`datasets[].metrics`) |
|---|---|---|
| Expression references | Fields of any dataset in the model, qualified: `dataset.field` | Fields of its own dataset, qualified: `dataset.field`; columns of its `source`, unqualified: `column` |
| Name uniqueness | Unique across the semantic model | Unique within its dataset, and distinct from that dataset's field names |
| Referenced as | `metric_name` | `dataset_name.metric_name` |

**Rules**

1. A dataset-scoped metric's expression MAY reference the declared fields of its dataset and the columns of its `source`. A declared field is written `dataset_name.field_name`; a column of the `source` is written unqualified: `SUM(orders.net_amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT tax_id)`. A qualified reference MUST name a declared field of the declaring dataset. An expression that references another dataset MUST be declared in `semantic_model.metrics`.
2. Dataset-scoped metric names MUST be unique within their dataset. Two datasets MAY each declare a metric with the same name.
3. A dataset-scoped metric name MUST NOT collide with the name of a field of the same dataset, which under rule 5 would leave `orders.amount` ambiguous.
4. A model-scoped metric SHOULD NOT reuse the name of a dataset-scoped metric in the same semantic model. Validators SHOULD warn, and SHOULD attribute the warning to the model rather than to the dataset.
5. An unqualified metric reference resolves to a model-scoped metric. A dataset-scoped metric is referenced as `dataset_name.metric_name`.

A column used only inside a metric does not need to be declared as a field. Declaring one is how a metric reuses a field's expression instead of repeating it.

Because the two are spelled differently, a field and a source column MAY share a name without ambiguity. In a metric of `orders`, `orders.foo` is the declared field and `foo` is the source column, so declaring a field named after an existing column does not change the meaning of an expression already using the bare name.

Whether a bare name is a real column of the `source` is not checked, because that requires catalog metadata the model does not carry. A qualified reference is checked, because the field list is in the model.

Rule 1 places no limit on the complexity of the aggregation, and constrains the expression rather than the query. A dataset-scoped metric is joined and grouped like any other using the relationships declared in the model, so a metric declared on `store_sales` as `SUM(ss_ext_sales_price)` may still be grouped by `item.i_brand` or `store.s_state`.

**Which names may repeat**

Names are addressed in three ways, so a name may repeat across them without ambiguity:

| Kind | Addressed as |
|---|---|
| Model-scoped metric | Bare: `revenue` |
| Dataset-scoped metric | Qualified: `orders.revenue` |
| Field | Qualified: `orders.revenue` |
| Dataset | Only ever as a qualifier |

A model-scoped metric MAY therefore share a name with a field, or with a dataset. Rule 3 is an error because a field and a metric of one dataset share the same qualified namespace; rule 4 is a warning because the two names remain separately addressable.

**Example: dataset-scoped metrics**

```yaml
datasets:
  - name: orders
    source: sales.public.orders
    primary_key: [order_id]
    fields:
      - name: order_id
        expression:
          dialects:
            - dialect: ANSI_SQL
              expression: order_id
        description: Order identifier
      - name: net_amount
        expression:
          dialects:
            - dialect: ANSI_SQL
              expression: amount - discount
        description: Order amount after discount

    metrics:
      # Qualified, so this references the declared field net_amount
      - name: total_net_amount
        expression:
          dialects:
            - dialect: ANSI_SQL
              expression: SUM(orders.net_amount)
        description: Total order amount after discount
        datatype: Decimal

      # Unqualified, so this references tax, a column of the source that is
      # not declared as a field
      - name: total_tax
        expression:
          dialects:
            - dialect: ANSI_SQL
              expression: SUM(tax)
        description: Total tax collected
        datatype: Decimal

      - name: order_count
        expression:
          dialects:
            - dialect: ANSI_SQL
              expression: COUNT(order_id)
        description: Number of orders
        datatype: Integer
```

Referenced from a consumer as `orders.total_net_amount`, `orders.total_tax` and `orders.order_count`.

**Example: invalid dataset-scoped metrics**

```yaml
datasets:
  - name: orders
    source: sales.public.orders
    fields:
      - name: net_amount
        expression:
          dialects:
            - dialect: ANSI_SQL
              expression: amount - discount
    metrics:
      # INVALID (rule 1): references the customers dataset, so this metric is
      # model-scoped and belongs in semantic_model.metrics
      - name: revenue_per_customer
        expression:
          dialects:
            - dialect: ANSI_SQL
              expression: SUM(net_amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT customers.id)

      # INVALID (rule 1): a qualified reference must name a declared field, and
      # tax is only a column of the source. Write it unqualified as SUM(tax)
      - name: total_tax
        expression:
          dialects:
            - dialect: ANSI_SQL
              expression: SUM(orders.tax)
```

**Consumer guidance: flattening to a single metric namespace**

Hoisting a dataset-scoped metric to the model level requires qualifying its field references with the dataset name, and qualifying the metric's own name as `dataset_name.metric_name` since two datasets may reuse a local name. Use an equivalent encoding if the target namespace disallows dots.

A consumer that reads only `semantic_model.metrics` produces an incomplete representation of the model. This is a lossy conversion rather than a valid one: such a consumer SHOULD warn, naming the metrics it dropped, and MUST NOT present the result as a faithful representation of the source. Producers requiring maximum compatibility may continue declaring all metrics at the model level.

## Custom Extensions

Custom extensions allow vendors to add platform-specific metadata without breaking core compatibility. Each extension includes a vendor name and arbitrary JSON data.

### Schema

```yaml
custom_extensions:
  - vendor_name: string  # Free-form string identifying the vendor
    data: string         # JSON string containing vendor-specific data
```

### Vendor Names

The `vendor_name` field is a free-form string, allowing any vendor or organization to
define custom extensions without requiring changes to the core specification.

The following are well-known examples:

| Vendor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `COMMON` | Common/standard extensions |
| `SNOWFLAKE` | Snowflake-specific attributes |
| `SALESFORCE` | Salesforce/Tableau-specific attributes |
| `DBT` | dbt-specific attributes |
| `DATABRICKS` | Databricks-specific attributes |
| `GOODDATA` | GoodData-specific attributes |
| `HONEYDEW` | Honeydew-specific attributes |
| `WISDOM` | WisdomAI-specific attributes |

### Examples

**Snowflake Extension:**

```yaml
- vendor_name: SNOWFLAKE
  data: '{
    "warehouse": "ANALYTICS_WH",
    "database": "PROD",
    "schema": "PUBLIC"
  }'
```

**Salesforce Extension:**

```yaml
- vendor_name: SALESFORCE
  data: '{
    "tableau_workbook_id": "sales_dashboard",
    "einstein_enabled": true,
    "crm_sync": {
      "enabled": true,
      "sync_frequency": "daily"
    }
  }'
```

**DBT Extension:**

```yaml
- vendor_name: DBT
  data: '{
    "project_name": "analytics",
    "materialized": "table",
    "tags": ["daily", "core"]
  }'
```

**Databricks Extension:**

```yaml
- vendor_name: Databricks
  data: '{
    "default_catalog": "finance",
    "default_schema": "gold"
  }'
```
